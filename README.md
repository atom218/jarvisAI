# jarvisAI
this is a personal virtual assistant for your personal computer named JARVIS 

This code used the openAI API to gather and understand information by webscraping
This is a very basic project with limited tasks but it shows how any possible task is possible with only imagination being the limit
it performs tasks like opening chrome,youtube,google and other tasks similar to an Alexa like telling the time or reading out the weather
